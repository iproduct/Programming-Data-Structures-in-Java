1|Thinking in Java - 4th edition|Bruce Eckel|Prentice Hall|01.01.2006|1234567890123|Programming|Thinking In Java should be read cover to cover by every Java programmer, then kept close at hand for frequent reference. The exercises are challenging, and the chapter on Collections is superb! Not only did this book help me to pass the Sun Certified Java Programmer exam; it’s also the first book I turn to whenever I have a Java question. |java, programming, book|
