1|Thinking in Java - 4th edition|Bruce Eckel|Prentice Hall|01.01.2006|1234567890123|Programming|Thinking In Java should be read cover to cover by every Java programmer, then kept close at hand for frequent reference. The exercises are challenging, and the chapter on Collections is superb! Not only did this book help me to pass the Sun Certified Java Programmer exam; it’s also the first book I turn to whenever I have a Java question. |java, programming, book|

6|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Lewis Carroll|Dover Publications|20.05.1993|978-0486275437|Children Literature|The story is deeply but gently satiric, enlivened with an imaginative plot and brilliant use of nonsense. As Alice explores a bizarre underground world, she encounters a cast of strange characters and fanciful beasts: the White Rabbit, March Hare, and Mad Hatter; the sleepy Dormouse and grinning Cheshire Cat; the Mock Turtle, the dreadful Queen of Hearts, and a host of other extraordinary personalities. This edition features Sir John Tenniel's complete original illustrations, bringing to life a beloved classic that has delighted readers and listeners since its first publication in 1865.|tale, alice, wonderland|
